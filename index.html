    <h2>What</h2>
    <p>ReflectRite is a low-cost, easy-to-use document camera alternative that easily visualizes users’ teaching materials live. It is a simple product that offers a unique mix of high utility and low cost, while utilizing 100% recycled materials and using 0 electronic components to ensure longevity and ease-of-use.</p>

<div class="desc2">
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p> When the team
        took a look at competing products, we found that consumers viewed traditional document cameras as expensive and
        cumbersome. They also viewed alternatives as ineffective due to the product reflecting the camera straight down
        to the laptop keyboard. This prevents users from writing while showcasing their work at the
        same time. We took this feedback and implemented improvements into ReflectRite.
        The main design inspiration behind the product is a periscope, a small optical instrument which uses mirrors angled at 45 degrees to reflect an image.</p>
